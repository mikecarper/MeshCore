// Fork-owned, dependency-free MQTT bridge lifecycle state machine and the
// narrow dependency seam used to drive it deterministically in host tests.
//
// This is the Phase 4 "ownership and teardown test seam" from
// STABILITY_TESTABILITY_HANDOFF.md. It is intentionally pure (no Arduino,
// FreeRTOS, WiFi, or PsychicMqttClient dependencies) so the exact
// start/stop/restart contract can be exercised with a fake clock and a
// recording Ops double, the same way MQTTConnectionPolicy.h and
// MQTTRuntimeBufferLifecycle.h are tested.
//
// Scope boundary (Phase 4 vs Phase 5): this header is the SPEC and the test
// seam. It is not yet wired into MQTTBridge. Phase 5 ("Implement cooperative
// MQTT shutdown") supplies FreeRTOS/PsychicMqttClient-backed Ops and replaces
// the abrupt vTaskDelete in MQTTBridge::end() with this cooperative lifecycle.
// See MQTT_OWNERSHIP.md for the ownership model and the migration plan.
//
// Behavior source (Phase 0 discipline): every transition and invariant encoded
// here is derived from the current MQTTBridge.cpp control flow (begin()/end(),
// mqttTaskLoop(), the volatile handshakes) -- not from a hardware soak. Values
// that require on-hardware characterization (the concrete stop timeout, exact
// mbedTLS teardown timing) are called out with "Phase 0 TODO" and left as
// injectable parameters rather than guessed constants.
namespace MQTTLifecycle {

// The lifecycle proposed by the handoff:
//   Stopped -> Starting -> Running -> StopRequested -> Stopping -> Stopped
//
// StopRequested: a stop has been requested and delivered through the ownership
//   channel, but the MQTT task has not yet begun its ordered shutdown.
// Stopping:      the MQTT task is performing its ordered client/service
//   shutdown. A StopBegan signal is optional; a task may ack directly from
//   StopRequested if it does not report the intermediate step.
enum class State : uint8_t {
  Stopped = 0,
  Starting,
  Running,
  StopRequested,
  Stopping,
};

// Events driven either by the owner (loop task) or by the MQTT task reporting
// its own progress. StopTimedOut is synthesized by the Coordinator when a stop
// is not acknowledged within the bounded timeout (the reviewed fallback).
enum class Event : uint8_t {
  StartRequested = 0,  // owner asked the bridge to start
  StartCompleted,      // MQTT task signalled init complete (StartAck)
  StartFailed,         // init failed on the task (partial-init rollback)
  StopRequested,       // owner (or OTA barrier) asked the bridge to stop
  StopBegan,           // MQTT task began its ordered shutdown (optional)
  StopAcknowledged,    // MQTT task signalled ordered shutdown complete (StopAck)
  StopTimedOut,        // bounded timeout expired with no StopAck (fallback)
};

// Side effects a transition asks the caller to perform. Naming WHO does WHAT
// keeps the Phase 5 production wiring and the host fakes on one contract:
//  - create_task:       owner creates/pins the MQTT task.
//  - deliver_stop:      owner delivers the stop request through the channel.
//  - release_resources: owner may now free the queue, runtime buffers, and the
//                       task handle. Fires only after a completed/forced stop
//                       or an init-failure rollback -- never mid-run.
//  - ota_release:       the OTA barrier's completion acknowledgment is now
//                       available (a stop reached a terminal state).
