// Fork-owned (not upstream-tracked). Observer builds capture every received packet
// to MQTT, but RX processing needs a free pool packet first — Dispatcher::checkRecv()
// discards the received bytes before logRx() when allocNew() fails. Under duty-cycle
// throttling the outbound queue can park the entire pool waiting on TX budget, which
// starves RX allocation and silently caps MQTT capture at the TX rate (each completed
// TX frees exactly one packet for exactly one more RX). Parked retransmissions also
// absorb every budget refill, starving the node's own CLI responses/ACKs and making
// a heavily-throttled node un-administrable over the mesh.
//
// Two policies fix this, both confined to this manager:
//
// 1. Priority-aware shedding. Below the RX reserve, only low-priority outbound
//    (priority > 1: multi-hop flood repeats, adverts, trace) is refused; the node's
//    own responses/ACKs (pri 0) and login/PATH replies (pri 1) still queue. Below the
//    smaller emergency floor everything is shed to keep capture alive.
// 2. Stale-packet expiry. A queued packet still untransmitted STALE_OUTBOUND_MS past
//    its scheduled time is dropped at the next dequeue — a repeat delayed that long is
//    noise (the flood has long since propagated), and a CLI response that old has
//    already timed out at the client. Under normal load the queue drains in
//    milliseconds and this never triggers; under throttle it frees the pool and lets
//    fresh traffic (including admin responses) compete for the trickle of TX budget.
