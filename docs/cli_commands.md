**Note:** Each line is encoded as `{pubkey-prefix}:{timestamp}:{snr*4}`

---

### Remove a neighbor
**Usage:** 
- `neighbor.remove <pubkey_prefix>`

**Parameters:** 
- `pubkey_prefix`: The public key of the node to remove from the neighbors list. This can be a short prefix or the full key. All neighbors matching the provided prefix will be removed.

**Note:** You can remove all neighbors by sending a space character as the prefix. The space indicates an empty prefix, which matches all existing neighbors.

---

### Discover zero hop neighbors

**Usage:** 
- `discover.neighbors`

---

### Send flood text to `#repeaters` channel

**Usage:**
- `send text.flood <message>`

**Notes:**
- Sends a `PAYLOAD_TYPE_GRP_TXT` flood message using the built-in `#repeaters` channel key.
- Message format is `<node_name>: <message>`.

---

### View or change automatic low-battery alerts to `#repeaters`

**Usage:**
- `get battery.alert`
- `set battery.alert <state>`
- `get battery.alert.low`
- `set battery.alert.low <percent>`
- `get battery.alert.critical`
- `set battery.alert.critical <percent>`

**Parameters:**
- `state`: `on` (enable) or `off` (disable)
- `percent`: Battery percentage threshold

**Default:** `off`

**Default thresholds:** `20` for `battery.alert.low`, `10` for `battery.alert.critical`

**Notes:**
- When enabled, sends a `#repeaters` flood text warning if voltage is above `1 V` and the battery estimate is below `battery.alert.low`.
- Warnings repeat every `24` hours, or every `12` hours below `battery.alert.critical`.
- `battery.alert.critical` must be lower than `battery.alert.low`.

---

### Get or set recent repeater fallback prefix/SNR
**Usage:**
- `get recent.repeater`
- `get recent.repeater <page>`
- `get recent.repeater page <page>`
- `set recent.repeater <prefix_hex_6> <snr_db>`

**Parameters:**
- `prefix_hex_6`: Exactly 3 bytes of next-hop prefix in hex (6 chars)
- `snr_db`: SNR in dB (supports decimals; stored at x4 precision)
- `page`: 1-based page number

**Notes:**
- `set` stores or updates the prefix in the recent repeater table.
- Rows are sorted by prefix width (3-byte, 2-byte, 1-byte), then SNR descending.
- A full direct retry failure lowers the stored SNR by `0.25 dB`.
- If a full failure has no row yet, it first seeds the row at the active retry cutoff + `2.5 dB`, then applies the `0.25 dB` penalty.
- Serial CLI page size is fixed at `128` rows; choose page with `get recent.repeater <page>`.
- Over LoRa remote CLI, page size is fixed at `7` rows; choose page with `get recent.repeater <page>`.
- Repeaters can use adjacent entries in this table to short-circuit non-TRACE direct packets when this node appears later in the direct path.

---

### Routing

#### View or change this node's repeat flag
**Usage:**
- `get repeat`
- `set repeat <state>`

**Parameters:**
  - `state`: `on`|`off`

**Default:** `on`

---

#### View or change this node's advert path hash size
**Usage:**
- `get path.hash.mode`
- `set path.hash.mode <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Path hash size (0-2)
  - `0`: 1 Byte hash size (256 unique ids)[64 max flood]
  - `1`: 2 Byte hash size (65,536 unique ids)[32 max flood]
  - `2`: 3 Byte hash size (16,777,216 unique ids)[21 max flood]
  - `3`: DO NOT USE (Reserved) 

**Default:** `0`

**Note:** the 'path.hash.mode' sets the low-level ID/hash encoding size used when the repeater adverts. This setting has no impact on what packet ID/hash size this repeater forwards, all sizes should be forwarded on firmware >= 1.14. This feature was added in firmware 1.14

**Temporary Note:** adverts with ID/hash sizes of 2 or 3 bytes may have limited flood propogation in your network while this feature is new as v1.13.0 firmware and older will drop packets with multibyte path ID/hashes as only 1-byte hashes are suppored. Consider your install base of firmware >=1.14 has reached a criticality for effective network flooding before implementing higher ID/hash sizes. 

---

#### View or change this node's loop detection
**Usage:**
- `get loop.detect`
- `set loop.detect <state>`

**Parameters:**
- `state`: 
  - `off`: no loop detection is performed
  - `minimal`: packets are dropped if repeater's ID/hash appears 4 or more times (1-byte), 2 or more (2-byte), 1 or more (3-byte)
  - `moderate`: packets are dropped if repeater's ID/hash appears 2 or more times (1-byte), 1 or more (2-byte), 1 or more (3-byte)
  - `strict`: packets are dropped if repeater's ID/hash appears 1 or more times (1-byte), 1 or more (2-byte), 1 or more (3-byte)
  
**Default:** `off`

**Note:** When it is enabled, repeaters will now reject flood packets which look like they are in a loop. This has been happening recently in some meshes when there is just a single 'bad' repeater firmware out there (prob some forked or custom firmware). If the payload is messed with, then forwarded, the same packet ends up causing a packet storm, repeated up to the max 64 hops. This feature was added in firmware 1.14

**Example:** If preference is `loop.detect minimal`, and a 1-byte path size packet is received, the repeater will see if its own ID/hash is already in the path. If it's already encoded 4 times, it will reject the packet.  If the packet uses 2-byte path size, and repeater's own ID/hash is already encoded 2 times, it rejects. If the packet uses 3-byte path size, and the repeater's own ID/hash is already encoded 1 time, it rejects. 

---

#### View or change the retransmit delay factor for flood traffic
**Usage:**
- `get txdelay`
- `set txdelay <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Transmit delay factor (0-2)

**Default:** `0.5`

---

#### View or change the retransmit delay factor for direct traffic
**Usage:**
- `get direct.txdelay`
- `set direct.txdelay <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Direct transmit delay factor (0-2)

**Default:** `0.3`

**Note:** Direct retry waits include the same airtime-based randomized delay calculation as direct retransmits, so this factor also controls retry echo windows.

---

#### View or change whether direct retries use the recent repeater blacklist
**Usage:**
- `get direct.retry.heard`
- `set direct.retry.heard <state>`

**Parameters:**
- `state`: `on`|`off`

**Default:** `on`

**Note:** When enabled, the recent repeater table is the only direct retry eligibility gate. Prefixes missing from the table are assumed reachable; prefixes in the table below the active SNR gate are blocked. Neighbor data is not used.

---

#### View or change adaptive coding rate for direct retry packets
**Usage:**
- `get direct.retry.cr`
- `set direct.retry.cr <cr4_min>,<cr5_min>,<cr7_min>,<cr8_max>`
- `set direct.retry.cr off`

**Parameters:**
- `cr4_min`: SNR in dB where retry packets use `CR4`
- `cr5_min`: SNR in dB where retry packets use `CR5`
- `cr7_min`: SNR in dB where retry packets use `CR7`
- `cr8_max`: SNR in dB where retry packets use `CR8`

**Default:** `10.0,7.5,2.5,2.5`

**Note:** DM retry packets use the next-hop SNR from a recent repeater table entry to pick a local transmit coding rate; if no recent entry is available, retry packets use `CR5`. With the default, SNR `10.0 dB` and up uses `CR4`, SNR `7.5 dB` and up uses `CR5`, SNR `2.5 dB` and down uses `CR8`, and the middle band uses `CR7`. `CR6` is never selected. Use `set direct.retry.cr off` to disable adaptive coding-rate overrides. If adaptive selection chooses `CR4`, retries after the third attempt use `CR5`.

---

#### View or change the SNR margin used for direct retry eligibility
**Usage:**
- `get direct.retry.margin`
- `set direct.retry.margin <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Rooftop preset margin in dB above the SF-specific receive floor (minimum `0`, maximum `40`, quarter-dB precision, default `5.0`)

**Default:** `5.0`

**Note:** `get direct.retry.margin` returns the active preset's effective margin. The retry gate uses the active SF floor of `SF5=-2.5`, `SF6=-5`, `SF7=-7.5`, `SF8=-10`, `SF9=-12.5`, `SF10=-15`, `SF11=-17.5`, `SF12=-20`, then adds this margin.

---

#### View or change the retry preset
**Usage:**
- `get retry.preset`
- `set retry.preset <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: `infra`|`rooftop`|`mobile` or `0`|`1`|`2`

**Default:** `rooftop` (`1`)

**Presets:**
- `infra` (`0`): `275 ms` direct base wait, `4` direct retries, `150 ms` added per direct retry, SNR gate is SF floor + `15 dB`; flood retry defaults to `1` retry and path gate `1`
- `rooftop` (`1`): `175 ms` direct base wait, `15` direct retries, `100 ms` added per direct retry, SNR gate is SF floor + `5 dB`; flood retry defaults to `3` retries and path gate `2`
- `mobile` (`2`): `175 ms` direct base wait, `15` direct retries, `50 ms` added per direct retry, SNR gate is the SF floor; flood retry defaults to `3` retries and path gate `1`

**Note:** Selecting a preset copies those values into the direct retry settings and resets flood retry defaults. You can refine `direct.retry.margin`, `direct.retry.count`, `direct.retry.base`, `direct.retry.step`, `flood.retry.count`, or `flood.retry.path` afterward. Retry delay is `direct.txdelay` jitter + base wait + packet-length airtime wait + per-attempt step.

---

#### View or change the number of direct retry attempts
**Usage:**
- `get direct.retry.count`
- `set direct.retry.count <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Maximum retry attempts after initial TX (`1`-`15`)

**Default:** `15`

**Note:** The effective value is capped by total direct path length: paths of `3` hops or less use at most `8` retries, `4` hops use at most `12`, and `5+` hops use at most `15`. A queued resend is canceled early when the next-hop echo is heard.

---

#### View or change the base direct retry wait (milliseconds)
**Usage:**
- `get direct.retry.base`
- `set direct.retry.base <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Base wait in milliseconds (`10`-`5000`)

**Default:** `175`

**Note:** The configured base is added to packet-length airtime and `direct.txdelay` jitter. Preset defaults are already reduced to account for the added `direct.txdelay` component.

---

#### View or change the direct retry per-attempt add time (milliseconds)
**Usage:**
- `get direct.retry.step`
- `set direct.retry.step <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Milliseconds added per retry attempt (`0`-`5000`)

**Default:** `100`

**Note:** This controls the linear add after the first retry wait. For example, `base=300` and `step=150` adds `0`, `150`, `300`, ... ms across retry attempts.

---

#### [Experimental] View or change the processing delay for received traffic
**Usage:**
- `get rxdelay`
- `set rxdelay <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Receive delay base (0-20)

**Default:** `0.0`

---

#### View or change the duty cycle limit
**Usage:**
- `get dutycycle`
- `set dutycycle <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Duty cycle percentage (1-100)

**Default:** `50%` (equivalent to airtime factor 1.0)

**Examples:**
- `set dutycycle 100` — no duty cycle limit
- `set dutycycle 50` — 50% duty cycle (default)
- `set dutycycle 10` — 10% duty cycle
- `set dutycycle 1` — 1% duty cycle (strictest EU requirement)

> **Note:** Added in firmware v1.15.0

---

#### View or change the airtime factor (duty cycle limit)
> **Deprecated** as of firmware v1.15.0. Use [`get/set dutycycle`](#view-or-change-the-duty-cycle-limit) instead.

**Usage:**
- `get af`
- `set af <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Airtime factor (0-9). After each transmission, the repeater enforces a silent period of approximately the on-air transmission time multiplied by the value. This results in a long-term duty cycle of roughly 1 divided by (1 plus the value). For example:
  - `af = 1` → ~50% duty
  - `af = 2` → ~33% duty
  - `af = 3` → ~25% duty
  - `af = 9` → ~10% duty
  You are responsible for choosing a value that is appropriate for your jurisdiction and channel plan (for example EU 868 Mhz 10% duty cycle regulation).

**Default:** `1.0`

---

#### View or change the local interference threshold
**Usage:**
- `get int.thresh`
- `set int.thresh <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Interference threshold value

**Default:** `0.0`

---

#### View or change the AGC Reset Interval
**Usage:**
- `get agc.reset.interval`
- `set agc.reset.interval <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Interval in seconds rounded down to a multiple of 4 (17 becomes 16). 0 to disable.

**Default:** `0.0`

---

#### Enable or disable Multi-Acks support
**Usage:**
- `get multi.acks`
- `set multi.acks <state>`

**Parameters:**
- `state`: `0` (disable) or `1` (enable)

**Default:** `0`

---

#### View or change the flood advert interval
**Usage:**
- `get flood.advert.interval`
- `set flood.advert.interval <hours>`

**Parameters:**
- `hours`: Interval in hours (3-168)

**Default:** `12` (Repeater) - `0` (Sensor)

---

#### View or change the zero-hop advert interval
**Usage:**
- `get advert.interval`
- `set advert.interval <minutes>`

**Parameters:**
- `minutes`: Interval in minutes rounded down to the nearest multiple of 2 (61 becomes 60) (60-240)

**Default:** `0`

---

#### Limit the number of hops for a flood message
**Usage:**
- `get flood.max`
- `set flood.max <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Maximum flood hop count (0-64)

**Default:** `64`

---

#### View or change the number of flood retry attempts
**Usage:**
- `get flood.retry.count`
- `set flood.retry.count <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Maximum retry attempts after initial flood TX (`0`-`15`)

**Default:** `3` for `rooftop` and `mobile`, `1` for `infra`

**Note:** `0` disables flood retry.

---

#### View or change the flood retry path gate
**Usage:**
- `get flood.retry.path`
- `set flood.retry.path <value>`

**Parameters:**
- `value`: Maximum flood path length eligible for retry (`0`-`63`), or `off` to disable the gate

**Default:** `2` for `rooftop`, `1` for `infra` and `mobile`

**Note:** Prefixes in `flood.retry.ignore` do not count toward this path length.

---

#### View or change whether advert packets are flood-retried
**Usage:**
- `get flood.retry.advert`
- `set flood.retry.advert <state>`

**Parameters:**
- `state`: `on` or `off`

**Default:** `off`

**Note:** When this is `off`, node advert packets (`PAYLOAD_TYPE_ADVERT`, type `4`) are not queued for flood retry.

---

#### View or change flood retry target prefixes
**Usage:**
- `get flood.retry.prefixes`
- `set flood.retry.prefixes <prefixes>`

**Parameters:**
- `prefixes`: Comma-separated 3-byte hex prefixes, such as `A1B2C3,D4E5F6`; use `none` or `off` to clear

**Default:** `none`

**Note:** Prefixes are stored as 3 bytes. Flood retry skips packets whose path already contains a matching target prefix. When prefixes are configured, only a downstream echo from one of those target prefixes cancels a queued retry; when no prefixes are configured, any downstream echo cancels it. Matching works with 3-byte, 2-byte, or 1-byte flood paths by comparing the matching leading bytes.

---

#### View or change flood retry bridge mode
**Usage:**
- `get flood.retry.bridge`
- `set flood.retry.bridge <state>`

**Parameters:**
- `state`: `on` or `off`

**Default:** `off`

**Note:** Bridge mode uses bucket definitions instead of the single `flood.retry.prefixes` target list. It also has an implicit unconfigured catch-all bucket. If a flood comes from one fresh configured bucket, retry continues until every other fresh configured bucket plus the catch-all bucket has been heard or `flood.retry.count` is exhausted. If a flood comes from an unconfigured or pathless source, retry targets every fresh configured bucket. This means one configured bucket bridges between that bucket and everything else. Prefixes in `flood.retry.ignore` never count as heard bridge targets.

---

#### View or change flood retry bridge buckets
**Usage:**
- `get flood.retry.bucket.<bucket>`
- `set flood.retry.bucket <bucket> <prefixes>`

**Parameters:**
- `bucket`: Bucket number (`1`-`6`)
- `prefixes`: Up to 17 comma-separated 3-byte hex prefixes, such as `AABBCC,223344`; use `none` or `off` to clear

**Default:** all buckets empty

**Note:** Prefixes are stored as 3 bytes but match 3-byte, 2-byte, and 1-byte flood paths by comparing leading bytes. Bucket prefixes are included in bridge retry logic only if they were heard in the recent repeater table within the last hour.

---

#### View or change flood retry ignored prefixes
**Usage:**
- `get flood.retry.ignore`
- `set flood.retry.ignore <prefixes>`

**Parameters:**
- `prefixes`: Up to 8 comma-separated 3-byte hex prefixes, such as `AABBCC,223344`; use `none` or `off` to clear

**Default:** empty

**Note:** In non-bridge retry, an echo whose last hop matches an ignored prefix does not cancel a queued retry as successful. In bridge mode, ignored prefixes do not count as a heard bridge bucket or as the implicit catch-all bucket when bridge retry decides whether every target has repeated the flood.

---

**Notes:**
- These commands require remote client context; they target the caller's ACL entry.
- The path hash size is inferred from the hop hash width.
- `outpath` overrides the primary direct route used for replies to the caller.
- `direct` sets a zero-hop direct route for a caller reachable without repeaters.
- `clear` forgets the current direct path and allows normal path discovery to repopulate it.
- `flood` forces replies to use flood packets until the client logs in again.
- `altpath` is an optional second direct route used for duplicate response attempts.
- `set altpath clear` removes the duplicate route so only one reply is sent.

### Region Examples

**Example 1: Using F Flag with Named Public Region**
```
region load
#Europe F
<blank line to end region load>
region save
```

**Explanation:**
- Creates a region named `#Europe` with flooding enabled
- Packets from this region will be flooded to other nodes

---

**Example 2: Using Wildcard with F Flag**
```
region load 
* F
<blank line to end region load>
region save
```

**Explanation:**
- Creates a wildcard region `*` with flooding enabled
- Enables flooding for all regions automatically
- Applies only to packets without transport codes

---

**Example 3: Using Wildcard Without F Flag**
```
region load 
*
<blank line to end region load>
region save
```
**Explanation:**
- Creates a wildcard region `*` without flooding
- This region exists but doesn't affect packet distribution
- Used as a default/empty region

---

**Example 4: Nested Public Region with F Flag**
```
region load 
#Europe F
  #UK
    #London
    #Manchester
  #France
    #Paris
    #Lyon
<blank line to end region load>
region save
```

**Explanation:**
- Creates `#Europe` region with flooding enabled
- Adds nested child regions (`#UK`, `#France`)
- All nested regions inherit the flooding flag from parent

---

**Example 5: Wildcard with Nested Public Regions**
```
region load 
* F
  #NorthAmerica
    #USA
      #NewYork
      #California
    #Canada
      #Ontario
      #Quebec
<blank line to end region load>
region save
```

**Explanation:**
- Creates wildcard region `*` with flooding enabled
- Adds nested `#NorthAmerica` hierarchy
- Enables flooding for all child regions automatically
- Useful for global networks with specific regional rules
