"""Check the portal terminal's command table against the mock backend.

Autocomplete in webui/index.html carries its own list of commands. Nothing ties
that list to what a node actually answers, so it can quietly drift into offering
commands that do not exist -- or, more often here, the mock can lag the table and
make a perfectly real command look broken.

This drives every command the table offers through /api/cli and reports the ones
that come back an error, so the two stay honest about each other.

    python3 scripts/webconfig_mock_server.py --port 8137 &
    python3 scripts/webconfig_cli_audit.py

Board-specific commands (Board::handleCommand) are offered only when the node
says it answers them, so one run exercises one shape of board. The mock claims
none by default, like a Heltec V3; drive the other shapes with --board-cmds:

    python3 scripts/webconfig_mock_server.py --port 8137 \
        --board-cmds radio.fem.rxgain,radio.fem.txgain,fan &

Exits non-zero if anything fails that is not in EXPECTED_FAILURES. Stdlib only.
